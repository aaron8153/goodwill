To whom it may concern:
 
I am submitting my resume in hopes that you may find I meet your qualifications for employment.  I have over twenty years of experience in the field of social services and training. In addition, I have set up and implemented programing for newly received grants.  I have been successful in the areas of direct care, case management, therapist, community liaison, computer training, community presentations, curriculum programming, teaching GED classes and management.  I have worked with clients dealing with mental retardation, homelessness, literacy, legal issues, victims of crime and abuse, pregnancy, mental health issues and various other socio-economic issues.  
 
In my previous position of Program Supervisor I supervised seven staff and had over site of my own building.  My clients dealt with mental retardation at various levels.  During this time I was able to make their environment more conducive to further growth and increase independence.  This was achieved through improving quality staff retention, cohesion and inclusion of all working with clients and working towards client goals.  As a result, clients and staff saw a reduction in violent client outburst by more than 90%.  Clients also not only reached more of their goals but were able to begin new goals.
 
It is my desire to utilize current skills while infusing new goals and methods with an organization that values quality and longevity.  I am seeking an opportunity to work with an organization that is strong in their mission and desire to partner with their clients in achieving their highest level of independence.
 
Please feel free to contact me at 314-766-7604 if you have any questions.  I look forward to an opportunity to speak with you.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Felicia Crenshaw
